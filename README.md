This is a small program I wrote for making the tracking of the player 
movement in the MindCrack Ultra Hardcore videos easier.
It requires the [Minecraft Automap Mod]( http://www.minecraftam.com) to work.
When started after Minecraft it connects to the Minecraft Automap Mod and queries 
the player location every 250ms. These locations can now easily be saved to a JSON 
formatted file (which is what I use in my maps for displaying the movements).

You can download the Binarys from [here]( http://88.198.183.184/uhc/UHC-Tracker_V0.4.4.zip )
Latest Version 0.4.4
